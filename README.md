# Food Recognition Challenge - Semantic Segmentation

### Overview
The food recognition challenge involves the building of a model to recognise and segment food items in each image. There are 273 categories of food items and each image may be a binary or multiclass image. More information on the challenge can be found on the [official website](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/food-recognition-challenge).

A report was written and submitted as part of the project. It may be viewed [here](https://github.com/lucamarini22/food-recognition-challenge/blob/main/res/report.pdf).

## Results
The project has been included as a .ipynb files and can be viewed using the [Jupyter nbviewer links](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lucamarini22/food-recognition-challenge/blob/main/food-segmentation-model.ipynb) or via Jupyter notebooks directly on a deskstop. 

Example images below show the original image, the true mask and the predicted mask of the model.
